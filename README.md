### Scalable Code Execution Environment - CodeRunnerX

CodeRunnerX: A Scalable, Dockerized Code Execution Sandbox as the name suggests, is an online code executor like seen on Leetcode, etc. For the project, we have implemented an _**infinitely scalable**_ code executor to run a code snippet. It will create a new file for each code input, execute it and returns the output. It supports major languages, i.e., C/C++, Python, Javascipt, Java and can even be extended to support more languages.

## Concepts
- Application is made infinitely scalable by utilizing the concept of serverless architecture, which is implemented with the help of the Serverless Framework and AWS Lambda Functions. 
- ```exec``` from NodeJS Child process module was used to execute the code snippets in a shell.
- Docker was used to containerize the application which contains all the required dependencies and that image is utilized for AWS Lambda functions.
- A CI/CD pipeline was setup using Github Actions for quick deployment.
